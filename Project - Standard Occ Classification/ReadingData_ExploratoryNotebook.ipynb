    "## Public-Use Sample of Occupation and Industry Write-ins from ACS 2009   \n",
    "\n",
    "Description : This public-use file shows industry and occupation write-in and code information from a sample of American Community Survey (ACS) 2009 records. The file provides data users with an idea of the types and variety of raw answers (write-ins) provided by respondents and the corresponding 4-digit Census classification codes given by the U.S. Census Bureau’s clerical coders. The Census classification codes are based on the SOC 2000 and the NAICS 2007. It should be noted that in determining the codes, clerical coders are provided with more information than is shown in this file, such as employer name, job duties, education, sex, and age.  \n",

    "\n",
    "[BLS 2018 Manual](https://www.bls.gov/soc/2018/soc_2018_manual.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification principles  \n",
    "\n",
    "The SOC Classification Principles form the basis on which the SOC system is structured. \n",
    "1. The SOC covers all occupations in which work is performed for pay or profit, including\n",
    "work performed in family-operated enterprises by family members who are not directly\n",
    "compensated. It excludes occupations unique to volunteers. Each occupation is assigned to\n",
    "only one occupational category at the most detailed level of the classification.  \n",
    "2. Occupations are classified based on work performed and, in some cases, on the skills,\n",
    "education and/or training needed to perform the work.  \n",
    "3. Workers primarily engaged in planning and the directing of resources are classified in\n",
    "management occupations in Major Group 11–0000. Duties of these workers may include\n",
    "supervision.  \n",
    "4. Supervisors of workers in Major Groups 13–0000 through 29–0000 usually have work\n",
    "experience and perform activities similar to those of the workers they supervise, and\n",
    "therefore are classified with the workers they supervise.  \n",
    "5. Workers in Major Group 31–0000 Healthcare Support Occupations assist and are usually\n",
    "supervised by workers in Major Group 29–0000 Healthcare Practitioners and Technical\n",
    "Occupations, and therefore there are no first-line supervisor occupations in Major Group\n",
    "31–0000.  \n",
    "6. Workers in Major Groups 33–0000 through 53–0000 whose primary duty is supervising are\n",
    "classified in the appropriate first-line supervisor category because their work activities are\n",
    "distinct from those of the workers they supervise.   \n",
    "7. Apprentices and trainees are classified with the occupations for which they are being\n",
    "trained, while helpers and aides are classified separately because they are not in training for\n",
    "the occupation they are helping.  \n",
    "8. If an occupation is not included as a distinct detailed occupation in the structure, it is\n",
    "classified in an appropriate ‘‘All Other” occupation. ‘‘All Other’’ occupations are placed in\n",
    "the structure when it is determined that the detailed occupations comprising a broad\n",
    "occupation group do not account for all of the workers in the group, even though such\n",
    "workers may perform a distinct set of work activities. These occupations appear as the last\n",
    "occupation in the group with a code ending in ‘‘9’’ and are identified in their title by\n",
    "having ‘‘All Other’’ appear at the end.  \n",
    "9. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau are charged with\n",
    "collecting and reporting data on total U.S. employment across the full spectrum of SOC\n",
    "Major Groups. Thus, for a detailed occupation to be included in the SOC, either the Bureau\n",
    "of Labor Statistics or the Census Bureau must be able to collect and report data on that\n",
    "occupation.  \n",
    "10. To maximize the comparability of data, time series continuity is maintained to the extent\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding guidelines  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following SOC coding guidelines are intended to assist users in consistently assigning SOC \n",
    "codes and titles to survey responses and in other coding activities.  \n",
    "1. A worker should be assigned to an SOC occupation code based on work performed.  \n",
    "2. When workers in a single job could be coded in more than one occupation, they should be\n",
    "coded in the occupation that requires the highest level of skill. If there is no measurable\n",
    "difference in skill requirements, workers should be coded in the occupation in which they\n",
    "spend the most time. Workers whose job is to teach at different levels (e.g., elementary,\n",
    "middle, or secondary) should be coded in the occupation corresponding to the highest\n",
    "educational level they teach.  \n",
    "3. Data collection and reporting agencies should assign workers to the most detailed\n",
    "occupation possible. Different agencies may use different levels of aggregation, depending\n",
    "on their ability to collect data.  \n",
    "4. Workers who perform activities not described in any distinct detailed occupation in the\n",
    "SOC structure should be coded in an appropriate ‘‘All Other’’ occupation. These\n",
    "occupations appear as the last occupation in a group with a code ending in ‘‘9’’ and are\n",
    "identified by having the words ‘‘All Other’’ appear at the end of the title.  \n",
    "5. Workers in Major Groups 33–0000 through 53–0000 who spend 80 percent or more of their\n",
    "time performing supervisory activities are coded in the appropriate first-line supervisor\n",
    "category in the SOC. In these same Major Groups (33–0000 through 53– 0000), persons\n",
    "with supervisory duties who spend less than 80 percent of their time supervising are coded\n",
    "with the workers they supervise.  \n",
    "6. Licensed and non-licensed workers performing the same work should be coded together in\n",
    "the same detailed occupation, except where specified otherwise in the SOC definition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### SOC coding structure  \n",
    "\n",
    "The occupations in the SOC are classified at four levels of aggregation to suit the needs of \n",
    "various data users: major group, minor group, broad occupation, and detailed occupation. Each \n",
    "lower level of detail identifies a more specific group of occupations. The 23 major groups, listed \n",
    "below, are divided into 98 minor groups, 459 broad occupations, and 867 detailed occupations.  \n",
    "2018 SOC major groups  \n",

    "structure are provided in the following section, Approved modifications to the structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Major groups are broken into minor groups, which, in turn, are divided into broad occupations. \n",
    "Broad occupations are then divided into one or more detailed occupations, as follows:  \n",

    "Occupations).   \n",

    "Each item in the SOC is designated by a six-digit code. The hyphen between the second and third \n",
    "digit is used only for clarity. (See figure 1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1](MarkdownFingures/BLS_2018_Figure1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in figure 2, “All Other” occupations (and “Other” or “Miscellaneous” occupations), \n",
    "whether at the detailed or broad occupation or minor group level, contain a “9” at the level of the \n",
    "“All Other” occupation. Minor groups that are major group “All Other” occupations end in 9000 \n",
    "(e.g., 33-9000, Other Protective Service Workers). Broad occupations that are minor group “All \n",
    "Other” occupations end in 90 (e.g., 33-9090, Miscellaneous Protective Service Workers). \n",
    "Detailed “All Other” occupations end in 9 (e.g., 33-9099, Protective Service Workers, All \n",
    "Other).  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1](MarkdownFingures/BLS_2018_Figure2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are more than nine broad occupations in a minor group (e.g., 51-9000 Other Production \n",
    "Occupations); or more than eight, if there is no “All Other” occupation (e.g., 47-2000 \n",
    "Construction Trades Workers), then the code xx-x090 is skipped (reserved for “All Other” \n",
    "occupations), the code xx-x000 is skipped (reserved for minor groups), and the numbering \n",
    "system will continue with code xx-x110. The “All Other” broad occupation is then code xx-x190 \n",
    "or xx-x290 (e.g., 51-9190, Miscellaneous Production Workers).   \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is comprehensive, and encompasses all occupations in the U.S. economy. If a \n",
    "specific occupation is not listed, it is included in an “All Other” category with similar \n",
    "occupations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed occupations are identified and defined so that each occupation includes workers who \n",
    "perform similar job tasks as described in Classification Principle 2. Definitions begin with the \n",
    "duties that all workers in the occupation perform. Some definitions include a sentence at the end \n",
    "describing tasks workers in an occupation may, but do not necessarily have to perform, in order \n",
    "to be included in the occupation. Where the definitions include tasks also performed by workers \n",
    "in another occupation, cross-references to that occupation are provided in the definition.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 identifies the eight elements that appear in detailed SOC occupations. All six-digit \n",
    "detailed occupations have a (1) SOC code, (2) title, and (3) definition. All workers classified in \n",
    "an occupation are required to perform the duties described in (4) the first sentence(s) of each \n",
    "definition that do not start with “May.” Some definitions also have a (5) “May” statement, a (6) \n",
    "“Includes” statement, and/or a (7) “Excludes” statement. Almost all occupations have one or \n",
    "more (8) “Illustrative Examples.” Illustrative examples are job titles classified in only that \n",
    "occupation, and were selected from the Direct Match Title File.   \n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1](MarkdownFingures/BLS_2018_Figure3.png)  \n",
    "\n",
    "“May” statements describe tasks that workers in that occupation may—but are not required to—\n",
    "perform in order to be classified with Survey Researchers. The “Includes” statement identifies \n",
    "particular workers who should be classified with Survey Researchers. The “Excludes” statement \n",
    "indicates other detailed occupations that may be similar to Survey Researchers and clarifies that \n",
    "workers who fall into those occupations should be excluded from Survey Researchers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approved modifications to the structure   \n",
    "Agencies may use the SOC or parts of the SOC at varying levels of the system. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "data may be collected at the broad occupation level in some areas and at the detailed level in \n",
    "others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Occupations below the detailed level  \n",
    "\n",
    "The coding system is designed to allow SOC users desiring a delineation of occupations below \n",
    "the detailed occupation level to use a decimal point and additional digit(s) after the sixth digit. \n",
    "For example, Secondary School Teachers, Except Special and Career/Technical Education (25-\n",
    "2031) is a detailed occupation. Agencies wishing to collect more particular information on \n",
    "teachers by subject matter might use 25-2031.01 for secondary school science teachers or 25-\n",
    "2031.02 for secondary school mathematics teachers. Additional levels of detail also may be used \n",
    "to distinguish workers who have different training or years of experience.   \n",
    "OMB recommends that SOC users needing extra detail should employ the structure of the \n",
    "Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration’s Occupational Information \n",
    "Network (O*NET). For more information, see https://online.onetcenter.org.   \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher levels of aggregation  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some users may wish to present occupational data at higher levels of aggregation than the SOC \n",
    "major groups. To meet this need and to maintain consistency and comparability across datasets, \n",
